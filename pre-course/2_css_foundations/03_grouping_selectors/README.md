# Grouping Selectors

Give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. 

This will help you further practice adding classes and using class selectors, so be sure you add the class attribute in the HTML file. For the remainder of these exercises, the format of any colors is entirely up to you; we trust you'll practice using the different values! The properties you need to add to each element are:

* The first element: a black background and white text
* The second element: a yellow background
* Both elements: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback

# Self Check

* Does each element have a unique class name?
* Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
* Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
